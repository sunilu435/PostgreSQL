Introduction 
PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.

How postgresql is different from mysql?
MySQL is a purely relational database, whereas PostgreSQL is an object-relational database. PostgreSQL offers more sophisticated data types, and lets objects inherit properties. On the flip side, it also makes it more complex to work with PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL houses a single, ACID-compliant storage engine.
